# We created 4 variables: radius_of_circle, pi,
# area_of_circle, and nice_string.
# radius_of_circle and pi are both numeric variables
# area_of_circle while producing a numeric type was
# created by combining the variables radius_of_circle
# and pi.
# Then created nice_string which is a string variable,
# which here is a combination of numeric(formatted as 
# strings) and string types.
# Lastly, printed the nice_string variable so the when
# the code is run through a terminal or in a cell there
# will be an output.
